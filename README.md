# ✈️ Airplane Crash Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Overview

The **Airplane Crash Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI project designed to explore and visualize historical airplane crash data. The dashboard uncovers insights about aviation accidents across different countries, time periods, operators, and aircraft types, helping users understand patterns, trends, and contributing factors in a user-friendly visual format.

Whether you're an aviation analyst, researcher, safety officer, or data enthusiast, this dashboard offers an intuitive way to analyze fatality rates, crash distributions, survival trends, and more—empowering data-driven decisions and learning.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Airplane crash datasets are often large, unstructured, and difficult to interpret at scale. Traditional analysis methods lack interactivity and fail to uncover deeper patterns in the data. This project aims to solve that by turning static crash records into **interactive, visual insights** using **Power BI**, enabling users to explore and interpret the data dynamically.
